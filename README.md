# Remote Laptop Roll-out \& Onboarding Experience



\# Remote Laptop Roll-out \& Onboarding Experience  

This project simulates a full remote laptop roll-out and onboarding workflow using a Windows 10 virtual machine in Oracle VirtualBox.



Because a standard Windows 10 ISO (Home/Pro) was used, the project includes:

\- \*\*Real screenshots\*\* from a functioning simulated laptop environment

\- \*\*Simulated onboarding steps\*\* showing where enterprise features \*would\* normally apply

\- \*\*Documentation explaining the true enterprise process\*\* (Azure AD Join, Intune enrollment, policy deployment)

\- \*\*A walkthrough illustration\*\* demonstrating the prepared virtual laptop



All real screenshot evidence is included in the `/Assets/Screenshots` folder.

\## Project Objectives

\- Prepare a Windows 10 virtual laptop for remote onboarding  

\- Simulate enterprise onboarding steps such as work account setup, security configuration, and productivity tools  

\- Document the real-world process for MDM/Intune enrollment 

\- Provide evidence via screenshots  



\## Quick Summary of Steps Completed

1\. Created and configured a Windows 10  VM in VirtualBox  

2\. Installed Windows 10 and applied initial configuration  

3\. Installed  updates and renamed device  

4\. Simulated enterprise onboarding actions  

5\. Installed common productivity tools (Teams, OneDrive, Office apps for illustratio)  

6\. Documented steps in KB  

7\. Simulated ticket logs and rollout checklists  





\## Note

This project uses a \*\*standard Windows 10 pro ISO\*\*, which does \*\*not\*\* fully support Azure AD Join or Intune MDM enrollment.  

However, the documentation clearly explains:



\- What WOULD happen in a real enterprise setup  

\- Which steps were simulated  

\- How the same workflow is implemented with Windows 10 Enterprise
